"""Chunk text into whole sentences for RAG retrieval.

Character/token cutting splits ideas mid-thought and hurts retrieval.
This example chunks by sentence so boundaries always land between
sentences, with optional overlap to carry context across chunks.

def chunk_text(text: str, lang: str, max_sentences: int, overlap_percent: int | float):
    """Split text into overlapping sentence chunks for retrieval.

    Segments *text* into sentences with :class:`yasbd.BoundaryDetector`,
    then slides a fixed-size window over the sentence list, keeping
    ``overlap_percent`` of the sentences from the previous chunk at the
    start of the next one. Chunk boundaries therefore always fall on real
    sentence boundaries, and neighbouring chunks share context.

    Args:
        text: The raw document text to chunk.
        lang: ISO language code passed to the boundary detector.
        max_sentences: Number of sentences per chunk.
        overlap_percent: Percentage of the window size to carry over
            between consecutive chunks. Clamped so the stride never drops
            below one sentence.

    Returns:
        A list of chunk strings. Each chunk is its sentences joined back
        together without added separators, so the original surrounding
        whitespace is preserved as-is.

    Examples:
        Integer and fractional percentages both produce whole-sentence overlap:

        >>> text = "Alpha. Beta. Gamma. Delta."
        >>> chunk_text(text, "en", max_sentences=2, overlap_percent=50)
        ['Alpha. Beta.', ' Beta. Gamma.', ' Gamma. Delta.']
        >>> chunk_text(text, "en", max_sentences=2, overlap_percent=50.5)
        ['Alpha. Beta.', ' Beta. Gamma.', ' Gamma. Delta.']
        >>> chunk_text(text, "en", max_sentences=2, overlap_percent=0.5)
        ['Alpha. Beta.', ' Gamma. Delta.']
        >>> chunk_text("", "en", max_sentences=2, overlap_percent=50.5)
        []
